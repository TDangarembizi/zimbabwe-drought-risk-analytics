# Project Scope

## Purpose
This project aims to develop a prototype data-driven approach for forecasting drought risk and estimating agricultural impact in Zimbabwe. The focus is on early warning and decision support rather than operational deployment.

---

## Geographic Focus
The initial prototype focuses on the following provinces:
- Mashonaland Central
- Mashonaland East
- Masvingo

These provinces were selected due to their agricultural importance and historical exposure to drought conditions.

---

## Agricultural Focus
- Primary crop: Maize  
- Rationale: Maize is Zimbabwe’s main staple crop and is highly sensitive to rainfall variability.

---

## Temporal Scope
- Time resolution: Monthly data  
- Historical coverage: Subject to data availability  
- Forecast horizon: Seasonal outlook

---

## Key Outputs
- Province-level drought risk indicators  
- Estimated maize yield impacts under drought scenarios  
- Visual summaries suitable for non-technical audiences

---

## Exclusions
The following are explicitly excluded from this phase:
- Real-time forecasting
- National-scale deployment
- Integration with government systems
- Mobile or farmer-facing applications

These exclusions ensure the project remains feasible within the prototype timeframe.

---

## Next Phase
Subsequent phases will expand geographic coverage, incorporate additional crops, and explore partnerships with public and development institutions.
