# Zimbabwe Drought Risk Analytics

## Overview
This project develops a prototype data-driven approach to forecasting drought risk and estimating agricultural impact in Zimbabwe. The focus is on early warning and decision support using publicly available climate, satellite, and crop yield data. The work represents an initial proof of concept, designed to be scalable during postgraduate study and applicable to real-world planning contexts.

## Problem Context
Zimbabwe experiences recurring droughts that undermine food security, rural livelihoods, and national economic stability. Responses are often reactive due to limited integration of predictive analytics across climate and agricultural datasets. This project explores how data science methods can support earlier, evidence-based decision-making.

---

## Objectives
- Analyse historical climate and vegetation trends relevant to drought conditions  
- Develop a prototype model to forecast drought risk at provincial level  
- Estimate potential impacts of drought on maize yields  
- Present outputs in a format suitable for non-technical decision-makers  

---

## Scope
This prototype focuses on:
- Selected provinces within Zimbabwe  
- Maize as a priority staple crop  
- Monthly and seasonal climate indicators  

National scaling and integration of additional crops and regions are planned in later phases.

---

## Data Sources
All data used in this project is publicly available, including:
- Historical rainfall and temperature records  
- Satellite-derived vegetation indices such as NDVI  
- Crop yield statistics from international and national datasets  
- Climate indicators related to El Niño and La Niña patterns  

Where necessary, data is cleaned, aggregated, and aligned to ensure consistency across sources.

## Methodology
The project follows a structured data science workflow:

1. Data collection and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory data analysis to identify trends and anomalies  
3. Feature engineering to capture seasonal and lag effects  
4. Baseline statistical and machine learning models for drought risk prediction  
5. Scenario-based estimation of agricultural yield impacts  
6. Visualisation of results for policy-oriented interpretation  

Model performance is evaluated using appropriate validation techniques, with emphasis on interpretability and robustness rather than raw accuracy.

---

## Outputs
- Province-level drought risk indicators  
- Estimated maize yield impacts under drought scenarios  
- Visual summaries and dashboards to support planning discussions  
- Reproducible analysis notebooks  

---

## Limitations
- The prototype relies on secondary data with varying levels of historical coverage  
- Informal agricultural activity may be underrepresented in official statistics  
- Predictions are intended for decision support rather than operational deployment  

These limitations are documented transparently and inform future development priorities.

---

## Future Work
Planned extensions include:
- Expansion to national coverage and additional crops  
- Integration of climate change projection scenarios  
- Collaboration with government and development institutions  
- Deployment of interactive decision-support tools  

---

## Intended Use
This project is intended for academic research, policy exploration, and development planning contexts. It is not a substitute for official meteorological or agricultural advisory systems.
