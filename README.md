#Zimbabwe Drought Risk Analytics

Overview

This project develops a prototype data-driven approach to forecasting drought risk and estimating agricultural impact in Zimbabwe. The focus is on early warning and decision support using publicly available climate, satellite, and crop yield data. The work represents an initial proof of concept, designed to be scalable during postgraduate study and applicable to real-world planning contexts.
