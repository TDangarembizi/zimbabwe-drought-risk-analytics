# Data Sources

This project uses publicly available datasets relevant to drought risk and agricultural production in Zimbabwe.

---

## Climate Data
- Historical rainfall and temperature records from international climate data repositories
- Monthly aggregated values used to ensure consistency across sources

---

## Satellite Data
- Vegetation indices such as NDVI derived from satellite observations
- Used as a proxy for vegetation health and drought stress

---

## Agricultural Data
- Historical maize yield statistics from international and national datasets
- Data aggregated at provincial level where possible

---
